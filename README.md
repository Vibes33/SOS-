SOS+ , THE FIRST COMPLETE SAFETY APPLICATION!

This is a personal project, not a definitive application, so don't hesitate to make recommendations, code changes or even add features! 

This is my very first complete project, and after 2 years of coding on my own, I'd like to start studying computer science in August 2024 to develop my skills! 

Lots of projects to come here, this is also my first use of Github so don't hesitate to let me know if I've done anything wrong! 

So here's a little presentation of the app and its features!

EMERGENCY QUESTIONNAIRE 

Let's start with the simplest and most essential feature, the emergency questionnaire.

This is a short questionnaire, working like a funnel, to determine which number would be appropriate for you in certain situations.

The questionnaire takes into account : 
- Your country ( with location, the app currently supports 3 countries, France , USA and Australia , I'd like to add more, but don't panic, you can choose the countries manually to test anyway!  )
- Your situation ( choose from a list of common situations )


And that's it! you're then redirected to a number you can now call by clicking on the Call button , you can also send an SMS , this feature links up with another SOS+ feature , which lets you add personal 
contacts , 
with country codes , when you call , or send an SMS to an emergency number , an SMS is automatically sent to all these numbers ( the emergency number and the numbers added manually ! )

All this leads us to the following feature: 

PANIC MODE 

this mode simply puts the application into "purified" mode, with only the most useful features in case of emergency, namely : 

- A guide explaining what to do if you have no network 
- A step-by-step guide to help you get help 
- and the emergency questionnaire

MEDICAL FORM 

Create your own medical record, to help the nursing staff, or remember your personal information, blood type, height, weight etc., you can even store important documents in this space 
and view them at will, the database used is internal to your device, so there's no risk of data leaks!

DIAGNOSTIC 

If you witness a high-risk situation or an accident, you can diagnose the situation and send it directly to the relevant authorities! A message will be sent to you with the information you 
have entered and your precise location, depending on the country you have chosen!

I've now presented the main features of the application, but there are still a few that I'll leave you to discover! I'm currently working on a companion for WatchOS, a few patches and also a 
few additional features, This project was my application to the SSC 2023, rewarded by a victory in this one and a presentation to the Apple teams in Cupertino, Susann Prescott and Tim Cook directly 
inside Apple Park, I hope you like this project too!
